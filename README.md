# WealthWise - Your Personal Finance Companion 

Hey there! Welcome to WealthWise - a modern, AI-powered personal finance app that actually helps you manage your money better (not just track it).

## What is this? 

WealthWise is like having a financial advisor in your pocket, but way cooler and completely free. I built this because I was tired of boring finance apps that just show you charts of how broke you are.

## What can it do? 

###  **AI Financial Advisor**
- Ask questions like "How much should I save?" and get real, actionable advice
- No generic responses - actual helpful financial guidance
- Available 24/7 (unlike real financial advisors who charge $200/hour)

###  **Smart Budgeting**
- Track income and expenses without the hassle
- Visual budget breakdowns that actually make sense
- Set realistic budgets based on the 50/30/20 rule

###  **Goal Tracking**
- Set financial goals (vacation, emergency fund, that gaming setup)
- Track progress with beautiful visualizations
- Get motivated with milestone celebrations

###  **Analytics That Matter**
- See where your money actually goes
- Identify spending patterns (yes, that's a lot of coffee)
- Monthly insights and recommendations

## Why I built this 

I was using like 3 different apps to manage my finances, and none of them felt... human. They were either too complicated (looking at you, enterprise software) or too simple (hello, basic expense trackers).

So I decided to build something that:
- Actually helps you make better financial decisions
- Doesn't judge your spending habits (we've all been there)
- Gives you real advice, not just data dumps
- Looks good enough that you'll actually want to use it

## Tech Stack 

Built with modern, reliable tools:

- **Next.js 14** - Because React is awesome, and Next.js makes it even better
- **TypeScript** - Catching bugs before they catch us
- **Tailwind CSS** - Making things pretty without the CSS headaches
- **MongoDB** - Storing your data securely
- **AI Integration** - Smart financial advice that actually makes sense
